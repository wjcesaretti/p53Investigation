# Investigating p53 and DNA Damage by William Cesaretti, Indiana University Bloomington (12/12/23)

This research explores the intricate dynamics between p53, a tumor suppressor protein, and DNA damage. P53 is central to cellular responses to DNA insults, dictating outcomes like DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. The study delves into how various extents of DNA damage influence p53-mediated reactions and how the rate of p53 production/degradation affects genomic integrity.

Significant focus is given to the relationship between p53 and MDM2, an inhibitor of p53, forming an autoregulatory feedback loop. Mutations in the TP53 gene, leading to dysfunctional p53, are prevalent in numerous cancers, emphasizing the importance of p53 in cancer biology.

The research employs a mathematical model to analyze the p53/MDM2/DNA damage system, considering different compartments (nucleus, cytoplasm) and factors like DNA repair rates and DNA damage levels. Interactive simulations and phase plots are used to visualize the system's behavior under varying conditions, revealing insights into the dynamic responses of biological systems to stress.

This investigation enhances our understanding of p53 dynamics in DNA damage and repair, with broader implications for cancer research and therapeutic strategies.
